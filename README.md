# Greenhouse Gamble
Greenhouse Gamble is a greenhouse and farmstead simulator in a simple 2D top-down retro pixel game style.

#### Your Story
You quit your systems administrator day job and bought a run-down homestead on a bit of land with a drafty barn and a small dilapidated hoop greenhouse. You just want to live simply and stay grounded to the earth. Your plan is to develop the farm and grow enough for your family with any extra going to support the community. No more 'five nines', no more 4AM calls, no more impossible demands, no more stress, it's just going to be relaxing and invigorating.

You were so eager to get started before winter hits that you couldn't wait until spring when you expect your final severance disbursement to clear. So you put almost all your savings into the purchase. There's no going back. You're all in.
